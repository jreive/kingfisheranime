This section will explain how to use Konachan's Library
<br />
<br />
<br />
= Running =

Well the first thing to get running is downloading the program from the [http://code.google.com/p/kingfisheranime/downloads/list download] page
or from the SVN, the SVN will have update that some beta version wont as the SVN is updated with every build where the Beta is ever build we feel safe to release.
<br />
<br />
Once you downloaded the program go to where you have downloaded it, then double click it
you will be welcomed by Konachan's Library Opening window.

<br />
The first button
<br />
<br />
<br />
This button takes you to the part of the program where you can search via your tags for images just like you can on there website with one difference you don't have to include `_` in all your searchs so if you was looking for Lucky`_`Star Scan rate:s on the website it would be
Lucky Stay, Scan and the safe option from the drop down on the program

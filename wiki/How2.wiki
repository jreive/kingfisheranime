This button takes you to the part of the program where you can search via your tags for images just like you can on there website with one difference you don't have to include `_` in all your searchs so if you was looking for Lucky`_`Star Scan rate:s on the website it would be
Lucky Stay, Scan and the safe option from the drop down on the program
